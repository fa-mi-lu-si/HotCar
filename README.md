# Project Summary

# Ideas
multithreaded coding on raspberry pi pico

use a GSM module A9G to send an alert message

The pi pico can connect to obd

to develop the business case
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas
(this involves making assumptions)

human presence sensors
- LD2410B
- RCWL-0516

phrase problems from a customers perspective
javelin board
(helps us asses the validity of our assumptions)

also focus on the use case because the judges may not only ask on technicality.

# Possible solutions
the response should be in stages
- a short alarm if the car is parked and locked while someone is inside
- when heat is rising
- activate ac (could cause battery issue)
- send sms
  - message and call
  - include link to the car coordinates
- trigger an alarm
- finally, unlock the car doors to make rescue easier

consider a notification even while the vehicle is moving if the temperature is dangerously high

use a battery to power the system.

radar sensors to detect micro movements
from a project at toyota, which detected occupants in the vehicle
[cabin awareness](https://pressroom.toyota.com/toyota-connected-cabin-awareness-concept-uses-new-tech-to-detect-occupants/)
it can also classify them
